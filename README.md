==========

  * **If you don't know the plan, please ask someone**
  * The site uses only one HTML file (index.html) which contains all pages written in HTML (because it's kinda easier to use HTML directly to do all kinds of stuff).
  * Navigation is done by transitions between content and by scrolling.
